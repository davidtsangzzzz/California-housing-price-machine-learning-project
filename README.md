# California-Housing-Price-Machine-Learning-Project
Housing has always been a pressing issue that needs to be addressed, but it is even more important to choose a home that better suits your budget and mental expectations. This project will build a model based on the different sizes of houses and the number of bedrooms and the presence or absence of a swimming pool as factors affecting the price.
